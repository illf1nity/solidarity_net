# Ruptura

Your economic reality, in numbers. See how much value your work creates and how much of it you actually receive.

Anonymous. No tracking. No accounts.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

## What It Does

Enter your salary, ZIP code, and work history. Ruptura calculates:

- **Productivity-wage gap** -- how much more value you produce than you're paid
- **Worth gap** -- your pay vs. local market median for your experience level
- **Housing burden** -- rent as a percentage of income, homeownership affordability
- **Survival metrics** -- your gap translated into days and months of rent
- **Negotiation script** -- a personalized script backed by your numbers

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm

## Configuration (Optional)

The app works out of the box with embedded economic data. For live government API data:

### BLS API Key (Bureau of Labor Statistics)

1. Register at https://www.bls.gov/developers/
2. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export BLS_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

### HUD API Key (Housing and Urban Development)

1. Register at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/dataset/fmr-api.html
2. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export HUD_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

Then start with:

```bash
BLS_API_KEY="your-key" HUD_API_KEY="your-key" npm start
```

If API keys are not set, the app falls back to local data automatically.

## API Endpoints

### Core Calculator

- `GET /api/local-data/:zipCode` -- Cost of living data by ZIP
- `POST /api/impact-calculator` -- Productivity-wage gap analysis
- `POST /api/worth-gap-analyzer` -- Market comparison with experience adjustment
- `POST /api/negotiation-script` -- Personalized negotiation script

### Data

- `GET /api/economic-data/cpi?startYear=YYYY&endYear=YYYY` -- CPI inflation (BLS API)
- `GET /api/economic-data/yearly?startYear=YYYY&endYear=YYYY` -- Yearly economic indicators
- `GET /api/rent-data/hud/:zipCode` -- HUD Fair Market Rent by ZIP
